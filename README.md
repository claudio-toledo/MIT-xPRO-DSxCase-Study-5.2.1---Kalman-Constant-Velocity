# MIT-xPRO-DSxCase-Study-5.2.1---Kalman-Constant-Velocity
Case Study 5.2.1: Kalman Constant Velocity 2D Instructor: Guy Bresler  Activity Type: Optional   Case Study Description: Generate data, build the model for the motion dynamics, perform the Kalman Filtering algorithm. Kalman Filtering: Tracking the 2D Position of an Object when moving with Constant Velocity  Why this Case Study? Build your own implementation of the Kalman Filter on a simple example which can help you understand the building blocks of the GPS system.  Self-Help Documentation: In this document, we walk through some helpful tips to get you started with tracking the state of an object moving with a constant velocity using Kalman Filtering when we have noisy measurements of its velocity in 2 dimensions. In this tutorial, we provide examples and some pseudo-code for the following programming environment: Python.   Download Self-Help Documentation  Kalman-Constant-Velocity-Case-Study-Package.zip  Time Required: The time required to do this activity varies depending on your experience in the required programming background. We suggest planning somewhere between 1 &amp; 3 hours. Remember, this is an optional activity for participants looking for hands-on experience.
